Jobitor is an innovative job scraping application designed to streamline your job search process. Built with the power and elegance of the Laravel PHP framework, Jobitor meticulously scans various online job boards and company career pages to gather the latest job postings. It then intelligently filters and organizes these listings based on your specified keywords, location, and other preferences, presenting them in a clean, user-friendly interface rendered with Blade templates. With Jobitor, stay ahead in your job hunt by accessing a comprehensive, up-to-date, and tailored list of opportunities, all in one place.

## Features

- **Automated Job Scraping:** Gathers listings from multiple online sources using robust PHP libraries (e.g., Goutte, Symfony Panther, or native cURL/DOMDocument).

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Presents job listings in a clean and accessible web interface built with Laravel Blade templates.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get Jobitor up and running on your local machine.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * PHP (version as per your `composer.json`, e.g., >=8.1)
    * Composer (PHP package manager)
    * A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or use `php artisan serve`
    * A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nando-z/Jobitor.git](https://github.com/nando-z/Jobitor.git)
    cd Jobitor
    ```

3.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment file:**
    * Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    * Generate your application key:
      ```bash
      php artisan key:generate
      ```
    * Configure your database connection and other environment variables in the `.env` file (e.g., `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).

5.  **Run database migrations (and seeders if any):**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed  # Add --seed if you have database seeders
    ```

6.  **Link storage (if you use public disk for uploads, etc.):**
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

7.  **Configure (Optional - TODO: Add details if any):**
    * If there are specific configuration steps (e.g., API keys in `config/services.php`, defining target websites in a config file), list them here.
    * Example: `You might need to configure your target scraping sites in `config/jobitor.php` (create this file if needed).`

8.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
    Or, configure your web server (Apache/Nginx) to point to the `public` directory of your Jobitor project.

9.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the URL provided by your web server).
